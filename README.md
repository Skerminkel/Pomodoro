# Pomodoro
A study/productivity timer based on the Pomodora Technique by Francesco Cirillo


The file named Pomodora (rip spelling) contains the .exe for the program which will allow you to run it as normal. Probably my favorite project so far since I use it every day.
Project written in Python, then converted to an executable using auto-py-to-exe.
